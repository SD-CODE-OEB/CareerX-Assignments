                    <p>IndiGo flight 6E-286 returned to the gate at Mumbai airport after the crew spotted an overbooked
                        passenger standing at the back. The passenger was later offloaded and the flight departed after
                        a
                        delay of over an hour. IndiGo said it followed the standard operating procedure and offloaded
                        the
                        passenger as the flight was overbooked.
