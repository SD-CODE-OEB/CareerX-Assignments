            <p>
                ☛ Much of my Inspiration comes from my family who supports me to
                move forward and overcome the obstacles of life.<br><br>
                ☛ Our's is a joint family where all of my elder cousins have
                studied hard and are being getting the fruit of life.<br><br>
                ☛ Especially, my Elder Brother who was nothing upto his high school,
                changed hid life formidably today, he has become successful today taking care of
                household and his parents with no regrets.<br><br>
                ☛ I am always encouraged and motivated by him to overcome my problems and also I am given many ideas to
                go onto acheive milestones.
                <br><br> ☛ I draw my motivation from him as he always encourages and helps people in his surroundings,
                irrespective of any relation to them.</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ I belive he has gained much experience of life thruogh the difficulties he has gone through,
                Especially at the time of his father's illness where no one was there except him to care of his mother
                and sisters.
                <br><br> ☛ Everytime I need any help on any matter, whether it be personal or educational, he's always
                got the right idea to do the right thing.
                <br><br> ☛ I am onto the journey to become as comfortable as he is in my life and give my parents the
                satisfaction they always wanted that I too have acheived something in my life.
